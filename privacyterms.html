            <h1>Privacy Policy for MoxyTok</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: August 28, 2024</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. We will post any changes to this page and update the "Last Updated" date accordingly. Please review this policy regularly to stay informed of any changes.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection from KOLs</h2>
            <p>We collect personal and professional information from KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) to facilitate collaborations, business partnerships, and marketing campaigns. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact information: Name, email address, phone number, and business-related information (e.g., TikTok username, social media handles).</li>
                <li>Professional information: Social media engagement metrics, follower demographics, content preferences, and previous collaboration history.</li>
                <li>Communication records: Details from your communications with us regarding potential collaborations, sponsorships, or business inquiries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Marketing Communications to KOLs</h2>
            <p>We send emails to KOLs for business purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration proposals.</li>
                <li>Sponsorship opportunities.</li>
                <li>Updates on products or campaigns relevant to your audience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may opt out of these communications at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any email or by contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:tiktokshop@moxytok.com">tiktokshop@moxytok.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>4. Commission Rates and Paid Collaborations</h2>
            <p>In some of our communications, we may include details regarding commission rates or compensation terms as part of our collaboration offers. Any commissions, payment structures, or incentives discussed will be fully disclosed in the email. These offers are intended for business partnerships and do not imply any obligation unless a formal agreement is reached between both parties.</p>

            <h2>5. Affiliate and Referral Links</h2>
            <p>Some of our emails may contain affiliate or referral links, which are used to track the performance of marketing campaigns and collaboration opportunities. By clicking on these links, you acknowledge that MoxyTok may receive a commission or other financial benefits if you complete a transaction through these links. These links will be clearly labeled, and we will disclose any affiliate relationships in our communications.</p>

            <h2>6. Non-Binding Offers</h2>
            <p>Any commission rates, collaboration terms, or offers mentioned in our emails are for discussion purposes only and do not constitute a binding agreement. Formal collaboration agreements, including commission structures, must be finalized in a written contract signed by both parties before any work begins or payment is issued.</p>

            <h2>7. Email Marketing Compliance</h2>
            <p>MoxyTok complies with all applicable email marketing regulations, including the CAN-SPAM Act in the United States and Canadaâ€™s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL). In compliance with these laws:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We provide a clear and easy way to opt out of promotional emails.</li>
                <li>All marketing emails include our contact information and a visible "unsubscribe" link.</li>
                <li>We process unsubscribe requests promptly within the legally required timeframe (10 business days for CAN-SPAM, 10 days for CASL).</li>
                <li>We do not use misleading subject lines or false sender information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By engaging with our emails, you agree to receive communications related to business opportunities, collaborations, and promotional offers.</p>

            <h2>8. Tracking and Metrics Analysis</h2>
            <p>To better tailor our collaboration offers and communications, we may track engagement metrics related to our emails (e.g., whether you open emails, click links, or engage with our offers). This information helps us provide more relevant business opportunities and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns. You consent to this tracking by engaging with our emails, and you may opt out of such tracking by adjusting your email settings (e.g., disabling image loading). For more information about how we use this data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tiktokshop@moxytok.com">tiktokshop@moxytok.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>9. Data Security and Retention</h2>
            <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect the personal and professional information of KOLs. We retain your information for as long as necessary to manage our partnership and business opportunities or as required by law. If you request the deletion of your data, we will securely delete your information unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons.</p>

            <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>As our business is located outside the United States and Canada, your personal and professional information may be transferred and processed in the country where we are based or in other countries where our service providers are located. We take steps to ensure that any international data transfers comply with applicable privacy laws, including securing appropriate safeguards when transferring data.</p>
            <p>If you are located outside the country in which we operate, please be aware that your data may be processed in a jurisdiction that may have different data protection laws than your own country of residence.</p>
